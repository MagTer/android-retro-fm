# Retro FM — agent instructions

Personal, unofficial Android app for the Retro FM live radio stream. Three Gradle modules:
`:core` (shared Media3 player/session, ExoPlayer, cast, ICY/now-playing, log sink), `:app`
(phone + Android Auto, Compose UI), `:automotive` (Android Automotive OS / Volvo). Code
namespace `com.retrofm.android`; `applicationId` `com.magter.retrofm` (permanent, shared by
`:app` and `:automotive`).

## Build

Local builds need a JDK 17 and the Android SDK on the environment (nothing is on the default
PATH on the dev host):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=~/.local/jdk/jdk-17.0.19+10   # dev host location
export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease :automotive:bundleRelease
```

- The Gradle heap is capped at `-Xmx2g` in `gradle.properties` — **do not raise it**; a 4g heap
  OOM-killed the whole session on this 5.8 GB host (swap has since been added, but keep the cap).
- Release R8 builds take a few minutes; prefer running them in the background so a long build
  can't stall the session.
- Release signing is driven by Gradle properties (`RETROFM_UPLOAD_*`, from `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
  or `-P`). Absent them, the release bundle is produced **unsigned** — never generate a keystore
  or commit secrets.

## Release (do not hand-upload)

Releases go out through GitHub Actions, not manual Play Console uploads:

- Push a tag `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` (or run the "Release to Play internal
  testing" workflow manually). It builds + signs both bundles and pushes them to Play **internal
  testing**: phone → `internal`, automotive → `automotive:internal` (two separate steps — the
  standard `internal` track rejects the automotive form factor, so they cannot share a release).
- **versionCode** is auto-derived from the run number (phone `100 + run`, automotive `1100 + run`);
  never bump it by hand. **versionName** is the literal in `app/` and `automotive/build.gradle.kts`
  — bump it per release (keep both modules in sync) and make the tag match.
- versionCode ranges are load-bearing: phone stays < 1000, automotive 1000+, so the car always
  prefers the automotive artifact.
- `.github/workflows/list-tracks.yml` is a diagnostic that prints the app's real Play track names.
- **Play "Automatic integrity protection" must stay OFF** (Play Console → App integrity). When on,
  Play injects a pairip licensing stub into the served APK; at car boot it can't reach the
  not-yet-started Play Store, shows a repeating "check that Google Play is enabled" dialog and
  kills the process — CarMediaService respawns the last media source, looping the dialog for
  minutes (root-caused 2026-07-25, fixed by disabling the toggle + shipping 1.0.34). It is a
  console-side toggle with no trace in this repo, and Play may enable it by default in release
  flows — check it if the boot dialog ever returns.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Automotive artwork must be `content://`.** AAOS ignores remote `https` artwork URIs and
  embedded bitmaps — it renders only local URIs. All art routes through `AlbumArtContentProvider`
  (`:core`), which proxies+caches the remote image behind a `content://` URI. Never set a raw
  `https` `artworkUri`/`artworkData` for the car.
- **Cast is off in the car.** `PlayerManager` never builds a `CastPlayer` on `FEATURE_AUTOMOTIVE`,
  and `:automotive` excludes the whole `com.google.android.gms` + `com.google.android.datatransport`
  dependency (their startup components trigger a "needs Google Play services" error on head units).
- **Ad muting is a private-circle decision, internal-only.** `RetroFmConfig.MUTE_ADS` mutes the
  broadcaster's spliced ads — acceptable for a personal internal-testing build, but it must NOT
  ship to a public/production track without resolving Retro FM/Bauer licensing (restreaming their
  station publicly is a licensing matter regardless of the mute).
- **Log hygiene is a wire contract.** Field logs leave the device via the remote sink (Timber +
  LogsinkTree); never log tokens, credentialed URLs, or PII.
- Live stream: reconnect retries indefinitely while playback is wanted and recovers on *validated*
  internet (`NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED`), reopening at the live edge — no stale buffer, no hard
  give-up. Don't reintroduce a fixed reconnect cap.

## Field logs

The app ships logs to a remote sink; read them for car/phone debugging (the car has no adb). The
DEBUG level is set via `applogs.falle.se/admin` (Entra-gated) and **resets to WARN on every
redeploy** of the log infra, so re-enable DEBUG before an investigation. The exact query recipe
(SSH → VictoriaLogs) is in the maintainer's personal notes, not the repo.

- The log client (`se.falle.logsink` in `:core`) is **vendored verbatim** from
  `github.com/MagTer/logsink-clients` — never edit it only here. Change upstream first, then
  re-vendor the files with the new commit hash in their 3-line header (the rest must stay
  byte-identical to upstream).
- The shim (`github.com/MagTer/logsink-shim`) **allowlists ingest fields server-side** — a new
  per-line field the client sends also needs a shim allowlist entry, release and redeploy
  before it reaches VictoriaLogs (it is silently stripped until then).
